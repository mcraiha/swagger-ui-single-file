# swagger-ui-single-file
Single HTML file version of Swagger UI

## Why ?

Because in some situations it is much easier to deploy/share a single .html file.

## Help

In most cases you want the files in [/templates](/templates) folder. Pick the latest, open it in your favourite text editor and replace the following line
```js
url: "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json",
```
with your own `swagger.json` file.

More details coming later on
